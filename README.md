# exploriing-workflows

* 1) ACCESS CURRENT VERSION:
**Go to our group 3 repository at ttps://github.com/Alannao/the-game and access our "Right Room" branch, my assigned Main tunnel1 folder, image subfolder, and/or the tunnel1.html file. 

* 2) WORK ON ENVIRONMENT; 

** A) If I need to work with the whole https://github.com/Alannao/the-game repository, I may download it into my IT 115 subfolder for the repository.  
**Because I use Mac and PC, I will use the appropriate non-terminal tools (Windows Explorer or Mac Finder) to move and access.  Current goal is to get more confident in my terminal management and use that route.  

** B) Alternatively or in addition, I will update my testing repository at https://github.com/kbish001/github-page-test.  I may edit and/or do pull requests in my own repository.  

* 3) EDIT TOOLS: 
** If downloaded to computer, I use Bracket's, Text ++, using basic text editor.  Open files in Brackets to work on them.  

** If on my Github test repository, I typically use the file edit function to edit the content of the html file and pull requests to update the image folder. However, because I am learning, I test different routes for each. 

* 4) SAVING AND TESTING 
**Test and retest in both environments before, during and after commits. 
**Save changes on each file and run the Brackets preview feature and/or do a pull request back into my own https://github.com/kbish001/github-page-test testing repository, test and run, to verify functionality.


* 5) PULL REQUEST TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO GROUP 3/RIGHT ROOM MAIN:
**To get back into our group directory I do a pull request back into https://github.com/Alannao/the-game/tree/main/tunnel1 for review and acceptance or rejections by other group members.
